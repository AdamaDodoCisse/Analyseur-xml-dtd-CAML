
     YOU NEED A LIFE PROGRAM TO VIEW THESE PATTERNS!

Here is a list of life programs that support these patterns:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LIFE 1.06 by Al Hensel, for PC's running MS-DOS.
http://users.vnet.net/alanh/life16.zip
As of this writing, this is still the fastest life program available
(per CPU cycle) that reads the patterns in this collection.

WLIFE, ported by Glen Summers, for PC's running MS-Windows 3.1.
http://www.gamesdomain.co.uk/directd/pc/windows/funstuff/wlife.html
A decent port of Xlife to Microsoft Windows.

WinLife by John Harper, for PC's running MS-Windows 3.1.
ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/games/winlife.zip
Probably the best overall Windows Life program.

LifeLab 3.1 by Andrew Trevorrow, for Macs -- Mac Plus to Power Mac.
ftp://ftp.kagi.com/downloads/akt/lifelab.hqx
Very powerful.  Autodetects gliders and oscillators, has
sophisticated editing, does automated searches for new patterns.

Xlife by Jon Bennett, for X window systems under Unix.
ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/X11-contrib/xlife.tar.Z
A classic.  Source code included.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

.LIF files are in a simple ASCII-based format that can be edited
using any text editor.  However, you still need a Life program to
enjoy the action.

If you are writing a new Life program, you may wish to refer to the
technical details of the .LIF file format found in WRITERS.DOC.

The collector who is responsible for this whole mess is Alan Hensel.

What is the meaning of LIFE?
----------------------------
LIFE is a classic computer game.  It was invented by John H. Conway
in 1970, and has entertained many hackers and wasted many years of
computer time ever since.  If you're smart and creative, it can be
very intellectually stimulating.  It's a simulation game which can
generate strange and beautiful patterns, sometimes in complex and
interesting ways.  Yet the rules of Life are delightfully simple:

- The game is played on a 2-dimensional grid.  Each square, or
    "cell", can be either "on" or "off".  
- If a cell is off and has 3 neighbors (out of 8), it will become
    alive in the next clock tick.  
- If a cell is on and has 2 or 3 neighbors, it survives; otherwise,
    it dies on the next clock tick.

For example, consider the following pattern, where '.' represents an
'off' cell and '*' represents an 'on' cell:
 .*.
 .*.
 .*.
Notice that the cells in the middle on either side are off and have
3 neighbors: they will come alive.  But the two '*' cells on the
ends each have just 1 neighbor; they will die of loneliness.

So the next generation is:

LIFE is like a box of chocolates....
------------------------------------
Since Life begins as a blank canvas, there is no end to the possible
ways to be creative with it.  Variety is the spice of Life!

It's common to start out by drawing random junk and seeing what it
turns into.  You can also draw lines, boxes, your name, etc.

Some of the patterns in the collection are like puzzles to figure
out: How do they work?  And how would anyone create such a thing?
For example: randgun, p94s, breeder?  What happens when you change
just one little cell...?  OK, that's fun for a while.  You get
familiar with the common stuff -- the stable patterns, the blinkers,
the movers and the shakers.

Then there's the engineering approach: try to invent a pattern that
does something interesting.  This is a challenge -- the Game of Life
is definitely not horseshoes or hand grenades!  Ever hear of the
Butterfly Effect?

For example, try to create one long, snaking line that remains
perfectly stable.  Along the way, you will discover rules, like the
offset-by-2 rule...  You'll know what that is when you find it.

Or you can try to create "billiard table configurations".  These are
mostly stable, with just a
